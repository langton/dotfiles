This repository contains the location-independent parts of my most
essential config files so I can quickly set up my development
environment on a new machine. I modify my .emacs file often; the rest
of the files rarely change. I try to maintain compatibility with GNU
Emacs 22+; some of the code in .emacs won't work on XEmacs or older
versions of GNU Emacs.

Feel free to use anything in this repository. Comments, questions, or
bug fixes? Email me at langton@gmail.com.
